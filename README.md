# Touch Model
This python program was developed as part of a Machine Learning class. It contains a polynomial regression model meant to improve touch screen accuracy.

Often there is an offset between where the user intended to touch (target) and the position registered by the device (touch). The model is capable of predicting the actual target a user meant to touch from a recorded touch.
